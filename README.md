# Getting Started with Vite

This project has been migrated from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a faster and more modern build tool for front-end development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages. Ensure that the `base` option in your `vite.config.ts` file is configured properly for GitHub Pages. For example:
```typescript
base: '/Tenebran/DayTrack-/',
